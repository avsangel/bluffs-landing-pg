        This was an important monument for the settlers, otherwise known as
        pioneers, who were going west across American. The Scottsbluff National
        Monument was a halfway point on the Oregon Trail.
        <br />
        During Wold War II, the Monument was used as a dog training base.
        <br />
        Not only does this rock contain so much history, but it is absolutely
        beaustiful. Its beauty has captured the eye of many big time
        photographers and directors.
